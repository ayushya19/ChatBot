Question,ExpectedAnswer
What is electricity ?,Electricity is a general term used for all phenomena caused by electric charge whether static or in motion.
What are the types of electricity ?,"There are two types,(1) static Electricity and (2) Current Electricity."
What is static electricity ?,Static electricity means electricity at rest in contradistinction to dynamic or current electricity the effects of which are purely due to the electrostatic field produced by the charge.
What are the sources of electricity ?,"(1)Battery, (2) Generator and (3) Thermocouple."
What are conductors ?,Conductors are those metallic substances which have a large number of free electrons and offer a little resistance to the flow of electricity through them.
What are insulators ?,Insulators are those nonmetallic substances which have comparatively very few free electrons and offer enormous resistance that they do not practically allow electricity to flow through them.
"What is ""Dielectric strength""?",Dielectric strength is the maximum kilovolts per millimeter which an insulating medium can withstand without breakdown.
What is the effect of heat on insulator ?,Insulator resistance of most solid dielectric with the possible exception of mica and asbestos is decreased with the rise in temperature and increased when cooled.
Where are semiconductors used ?,Semiconductors are generally used in electronic devices.
What is the unit of specific resistance ?,Ohm-meter.
What are the limitations of Ohm’s law ?,"Ohm’s law is not applicable to non ohmic conductors like vacuum tubes, discharge tubes and semiconductors."
What is conductance ?,It is the property of a material for easy conducting the current.
What is potential gradient ?,The potential gradient is the space rate of change of potential with respect to distance.
What do you mean by active and passive network ?,Active network means the electric network which contains one or more sources of e.m.f’s in if passive network means the electric network in which there is no source of e.m.fs.
"What do you mean by ""Eddy Current"" ?",Eddy current means the current induced in the interior of conducting masses by variation of the magnetic flux.
"What do you mean by ""Skin Effect"" ?",Skin effect means the action of alternating current that causes more of a current to flow near the outside surface that in the centre of a conductor.
