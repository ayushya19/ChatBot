Electricity and Circuits
e use electricity for many
purposes to make our tasks
easier. For example, we use
electricity to operate pumps that lift
water from wells or from ground level
to the roof top tank. What are other
purposes for which you use electricity?
List some of them in your notebook.
Does your list include the use of
electricity for lighting? Electricity
makes it possible to light our homes,
roads, offices, markets and factories
even after sunset. This helps us to
continue working at night. A power station
provides us with electricity. However, the
supply of electricity may fail or it may not
be available at some places. In such
situations, a torch is sometimes used for
providing light. A torch has a bulb that
lights up when it is switched on. Where
does the torch get electricity from?
Electricity to the bulb in a torch is
provided by the electric cell. Electric cells
are also used in alarm clocks,
wristwatches, transistor radios, cameras
and many other devices. Have you ever
carefully looked at an electric cell? You
might have noticed that it has a small
metal cap on one side and a metal disc
on the other side (Fig. 12.1). Did you
metal cap is the positive terminal of the
electric cell. The metal disc is the

Caution You might have seen the danger sign shown here
electric substations and many other places. It is to warn people that
electricity can be dangerous if not handled properly. Carelessness in
handling electricity and electric devices can cause severe injuries and
sometimes even death. Hence, you should never attempt to experiment
with the electric wires and sockets. Also remember that the electricity
generated by portable generators is equally dangerous. Use only electric
cells for all activities related to electricity.
Caution: Never join the two terminals
of the electric cell without connecting
them through a switch and a device
like a bulb. If you do so, the chemicals
in the electric cell get used up very fast
and the cell stops working.

then has to be replaced with a new one.
A torch bulb has an outer case of
glass that is fixed on a metallic base [Fig.

Take a torch and look inside its bulb.
You can also take out the bulb with the
help of your teacher. What do you

observe which part of the bulb is
glowing.
The thin wire that gives off light is
called the filament of the bulb. The
filament is fixed to two thicker wires,
which also provide support to it, as
shown in Fig. 12.2 (b). One of these thick
wires is connected to the metal case at
the base of the bulb [Fig. 12.2 (b)]. The
other thick wire is connected to the
metal tip at the centre of the base. The
base of the bulb and the metal tip of the
base are the two terminals of the bulb.
These two terminals are fixed in such a
way that they do not touch each other.
The electric bulbs used at home also
have a similar design.
Thus, both the electric cell and the
bulb have two terminals each. Why do
they have these two terminals?
AN ELECTRIC CELL
TO Let us try to make an electric bulb light
up using an electric cell. How do we do
that?
Activity 2
Take four lengths of electric wire with
differently coloured plastic coverings.
Remove a little of the plastic covering
from each length of wire at the ends.
This would expose the metal wires at
the ends of each length. Fix the exposed
parts of two wires to the cell and the
other two of the bulb as shown in
ELECTRICITY AND CIRCUITS
You can stick the wires to the bulb
with the tape used by electricians. Use
rubber bands or tape to fix the wires to
the cell.
Now, connect the wires fixed to the
bulb with those attached to the cell in
six different ways as have been shown in
find out whether the bulb glows or not.
Write 'Yes' or 'No' for each arrangement
in your notebook.
Now, carefully look at the
arrangements in which the bulb glows.
Compare these with those in which the
bulb does not glow. Can you find the
reason for the difference?
Keep the tip of your pencil on the
wire near one terminal of the electric cell
for the arrangment in Fig. 12.5 (a). Move
the pencil along the wire all the way to
the bulb. Now, from the other terminal
of the bulb, move along the other wire
connected to the cell. Repeat this
exercise for all the other arrangements
in Fig. 12.5. Did the bulb glow for the
arrangements in which you could not
move the pencil from one terminal to
the other?
In Activity 2 you connected one terminal
of the electric cell to the other terminal
through wires passing to and from the
electric bulb. Note that in the
arrangements shown in Fig. 12. 5 (a)
and (f), the two terminals of the electric
cell were connected to two terminals of
the bulb. Such an arrangement is an
example of an electric circuit. The electric
circuit provides a complete path for
electricity to pass (current to flow)
between the two terminals of the electric
cell. The bulb glows only when current
flows through the circuit.
In an electric circuit, the direction of
current is taken to be from the positive
to the negative terminal of the electric
cell as shown in Fig.12.6. When the
An electric bulb may fuse due to
many reasons. One reason for a bulb to
fuse is a break in its filament. A break
in the filament of an electric bulb means
a break in the path of the current
between the terminals of the electric cell.
Therefore, a fused bulb does not light
up as no current passes through its
filament.
Can you now explain why the bulb
did not glow when you tried to do so
with the arrangements shown in Fig.
Now we know how to make a bulb
light up using an electric cell. Would
you like to make a torch for yourself?
Activity 3
Take a torch bulb and a piece of wire.
Remove the plastic covering at the two
ends of the wire as you did before. Wrap
one end of a wire around the base of an
electric bulb as shown in Fig. 12.7. Fix
the other end of the wire to the negative
terminal of an electric cell with a rubber
band. Now, bring the tip of the base of
the bulb, that is, its other terminal in
contact with the positive terminal of the
circuit
terminals of the bulb are connected with
that of the electric cell by wires, the
current passes through the filament of
the bulb. This makes the bulb glow.
Sometimes an electric bulb does not
glow even if it is connected to the cell.
This may happen if the bulb has fused.
Look at a fused bulb carefully. Is the
filament inside it intact?

thermo Col sheet as shown in Fig. 12.8.
Make sure that the safety pin can be

that the free end of the safety pin can
touch it. The safety pin fixed in this way
would be your switch in this activity.

cell. Does the bulb glow? Now move the
bulb away from the terminal of the
electric cell. Does the bulb remain
lighted? Is this not similar to what you
do when you switch your torch on or
off? We had an arrangement for switching
on or off our home made torch by
moving the base of the bulb away from
the tip of the cell. This was a simple
switch, but, not very easy to use. We
can make another simple and easier
switch to use in our circuit.
Activity 4
You can make a switch using two
drawing pins, a safety pin (or a paper
clip), two wires and a small sheet of
thermo Col or a wooden board. Insert
Now, make a circuit by connecting
an electric cell and a bulb with this
switch as shown in Fig.12.9. Rotate the
safety pin so that its free end touches
the other drawing pin. What do you
observe? Now, move the safety pin away.
Does the bulb continue to glow?
The safety pin covered the gap
between the drawing pins when
you made it touch two of them. In
this position the switch is said to be 'on'
safety pin allows the current to pass
Hence, the bulb glows.
On the other hand, the bulb did not
glow when the safety pin was not in
touch with the other drawing pin. The
circuit was not complete as there was a
gap between the two drawing pins. In
Boojho has drawn the inside
of the torch as in Fig. 12.11.
When we close the switch,
the circuit is completed and

this position, the switch is said to be
'off' as in Fig. 12.9.
A switch is a simple device that either
breaks the circuit or completes it. The
switches used in lighting of electric
bulbs and other devices in homes work
on the same principle although their
designs are more complex.
INSULATORS
AND In all our activities we have used metal
wires to make a circuit. Suppose we use
a cotton thread instead of a metal wire
to make a circuit. Do you think that the
bulb will light up in such a circuit?
What materials can be used in electric
circuits so that the current can pass
through them? Let us find out.
Activity 5
Disconnect the switch from the electric
circuit you used for Activity 4. This would
leave you with two free ends of wires as
shown in Fig. 12.12 (a). Bring the free
ends of the two wires close, to let them
touch each other. Does the bulb light up?
You can now use this arrangement to test
whether any given material allows current
to pass through it or not.

What do you find? The bulb does not
glow when the free ends of the wires are
in contact with some of the materials you
have tested. This means that these
materials do not allow the electric current
to pass through them. On the other hand,
some materials allow electric current to
pass through them, which is indicated
by the glowing bulb. Materials which
allow electric current to pass through
them are conductors of electricity.
Insulators do not allow electric current
to pass through them. With the help of

which are insulators.

used for making wires.
Let us recall Activity 4 in which we
made an electric circuit with a switch

you may have found is an insulator.
What about the air between the gap?
Since the bulb does not glow when there
is only air in the gap between the drawing
pins in your switch, it means that air is
also an insulator.
Conductors and insulators are
equally important for us. Switches,
electrical plugs and sockets are made of
conductors. On the other hand, rubber
and plastics are used for covering
electrical wires, plug tops, switches and
other parts of electrical appliances,
which people might touch.
Caution: Your body is a conductor of
electricity. Therefore, be careful when
you handle an electrical appliance.
Electric cell is a source of electricity.
An electric cell has two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) while the
other is negative (– ve).
An electric bulb has a filament that is connected to its terminals.
An electric bulb glows when electric current passes through it.
In a closed electric circuit, the electric current passes from one terminal of
the electric cell to the other terminal.

How Magnets Were Discovered
It is said that, there was a shepherd
Greece. He used to take his herd of
sheep and goats to the nearby
mountains for grazing. He would take
a stick with him to control his herd. The
stick had a small piece of iron attached
at one end. One day he was surprised
to find that he had to pull hard to
free his stick from a rock on the

mountainside (Fig. 13.3). It seemed as
if the stick was being attracted by the
rock. The rock was a natural magnet
and it attracted the iron tip of the
shepherd's stick. It is said that this is
how natural magnets were discovered.
Such rocks were given the name
magnetite, perhaps after the name of that
shepherd. Magnetite contains iron.
Some people believe that magnetite was
first discovered at a place called
Magnesia. The substances having the
property of attracting iron are now known
as magnets. This is how the story goes.
In any case, people now have
discovered that certain rocks have the
property of attracting pieces of iron. They
also found that small pieces of these
rocks have some special properties.
They named these naturally occurring
materials magnets. Later on the process
of making magnets from pieces of iron
was discovered. These are known as
artificial magnets. Nowadays artificial

Let us walk in the footsteps of Magnes.
Only, this time, we will change the
positions of the magnet and the iron.
There will be a magnet at the end of our
shepherd's stick. We can attach a small
magnet to a hockey stick, walking stick
or a cricket wicket with a tape or some
glue. Let us now go out on a "Magnes
walk" through the school playground.
What does our "Magnes stick" pick up
from the school ground? What about
objects in the classroom?
Collect various objects of day-to-day
use from your surroundings. Test these
with the "Magnes stick". You can also
take a magnet, touch these objects with
it and observe which objects stick to the
magnet. Prepare a table in your
record your observations.
Look at the last column of Table 13.1
and note the objects that are attracted
by a magnet. Now, make a list of
materials from which these objects are
made. Is there any material common in
all the objects that were attracted by
the magnet?
We understand that magnet attracts
certain materials whereas some do not
get attracted towards magnet. The
materials which get attracted towards
a magnet are magnetic – for example,
iron, nickel or cobalt. The materials
which are not attracted towards a
magnet are non-magnetic. What
materials did you find to be nonmagnetic from Table 13.1? Is soil a
magnetic or a non-magnetic material?

Magnets were known to people from
ancient times. Many properties of
magnets were also known to them. You
might have read many interesting
stories about the uses of magnets. One
such story is about an emperor in China
a chariot with a statue of a lady that
could rotate in any direction. It had an
extended arm as if it was showing the
way (Fig. 13.8). The statue had an
interesting property. It would rest in
such a position that its extended arm
always pointed towards South. By
looking at the extended arm of the
statue, the Emperor was able to locate
directions when he went to new places
on his chariot.
Let us make such a direction finder
for ourselves.

ends in its position of rest. Does the
magnet now point in a different
direction? Rotate the magnet in other
directions and note the final direction
in which it comes to rest.
Do you find that the magnet always
comes to rest in the same direction?
Now can you guess the mystery behind
the statue in the Emperor's chariot?
Repeat this activity with an iron bar
and a plastic or a wooden scale instead
of a magnet. Do not use light objects for
this activity and avoid doing it where
there are currents of air. Do the other
materials also always come to rest in the
same direction?
We find that a freely suspended bar
magnet always comes to rest in a
particular direction, which is the NorthSouth direction. Use the direction of the
rising sun in the morning to find out
the rough direction towards east, where
you are doing this experiment. If you
stand facing east, to your left will be
North. Using the Sun for finding
directions may not be very exact, but, it
will help to make out the direction
North from the South, on your line.
Using this you can figure out which end
of the magnet is pointing to the North
and which points to the South.
The end of the magnet that points
towards North is called its North seeking

other end that points towards the South
is called South seeking end or the South
pole of the magnet. All magnets have two
poles whatever their shape may be.
Usually, north (N) and south (S) poles
are marked on the magnets.
This property of the magnet is very
useful for us. For centuries, travellers
have been making use of this property
of magnets to find directions. It is said
that in olden days, travellers used to find
directions by suspending natural
magnets with a thread, which they
always carried with them.
Later on, a device was developed
based on this property of magnets. It is
known as the compass. A compass is
usually a small box with a glass cover
on it. A magnetised needle is pivoted
inside the box, which can rotate freely
compass is kept at the place where we
wish to know the directions. Its needle
indicates the north-south direction
when it comes to rest. The compass is
then rotated until the north and south
marked on the dial are at the two ends
of the needle. To identify the north-pole
of the magnetic needle, it is usually
painted in a different colour.
There are several methods of making
magnets. Let us learn the simplest one.
Take a rectangular piece of iron. Place
it on the table. Now take a bar magnet
and place one of its poles near one edge
of the bar of iron. Without lifting the
bar magnet, move it along the length of
the iron bar till you reach the other end.
Now, lift the magnet and bring the pole
same point of the iron bar from which
you began (Fig. 13.11). Move the magnet
again along the iron bar in the same
direction as you did before. Repeat this
process about 30-40 times. Bring a pin
or some iron filings near the iron bar to
check whether it has become a magnet.
If not, continue the process for some
more time. Remember that the pole of
the magnet and the direction of its
movement should not change. You can
also use an iron nail, a needle or a blade
and convert them into a magnet.
You now know how to make a
magnet. Would you like to make your
own compass?

fixed in it, in different directions. Note
the direction in which the needle points

point in the same direction, when the
cork stops rotating?

Place the magnet in opposite direction
in car B. Now, place the two cars close
to one another (Fig. 13.13). What do you
observe? Do the cars remain at their
places? Do the cars run away from each
other? Do they move towards each other
and collide? Record your observations
in a table as shown in Table 13.3. Now,
place the toy cars close to each other
such that the rear side of car A faces
the front side of car B (Fig 13.14). Do
they move as before? Note the direction
in which the cars move now. Next, place
the car A behind car B and note the
direction in which they move in each
case. Repeat the activity by placing cars
with their rear sides facing each other.
Record your observations in each case.
What do we find from this activity?
Do two similar poles attract or repel each
other? What about opposite poles — do
they attract or repel each other?
This property of the magnets can also

Some common electric components can

some electric components and their
symbols are shown. You may come
across different symbols for these
components in different books. However,
in this book, we shall be using the
symbols shown here.
Look at the symbols carefully. In the
symbol for the electric cell, notice that
there is a longer line and a shorter but

Many devices such as torches,

batteries. However, in some of these
devices the electric cells are not always
placed one after the other as shown in
side by side. Then how are the terminals
of the cells connected? Look carefully
inside the battery compartment of any
device. There is usually a thick wire or
a metal strip connecting the positive
terminal of one cell to the negative
terminal of the next cell (Fig.14.3). In
order to help you to place the cells
correctly in the battery compartment,
‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols are usually printed
there.

after connecting to the electric supply,
their elements become red hot and give
out heat.
The amount of heat produced in a
wire depends on its material, length
and thickness. Thus, for different
requirements, the wires of different
materials and different lengths and
thicknesses are used.
The wires used for making electric
circuits do not normally become hot. On
the other hand, the elements of some
electric appliances become so hot that
they are easily visible. The filament of
an electric bulb gets heated to such a
high temperature that it starts glowing.
If a large current passes through a
wire, the wire may become so hot that it
may even melt and break. But is it
possible for a wire to melt and break?
Let us check it out.

An electric bulb is used for light but it also gives heat. This is not desirable. This
results in the wastage of electricity. This wastage can be reduced by using
fluorescent tube lights in place of the bulbs. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
also reduce wastage and can be fixed in the ordinary bulb holders.
However, before buying bulbs or tubes, or CFLs, look for the ISI mark of the
Bureau of Indian Standards. In fact, before buying any electrical appliance,
look for this mark. The ISI mark ensures that the appliance is safe and wastage
of energy is minimum.

steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes. Fig. 14.14 shows
fuses used in our houses. Fuses
shown in Fig. 14.15 are generally used
in electrical appliances.
CAUTION
Never try to investigate an electric fuse
connected to mains circuit on your
own. You may, however, visit an
electric repair shop and compare the
burnt out fuses with the new ones.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?

used in place of fuses.
These are switches which

What does this experiment indicate?
We know that the needle of a compass

current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.

insulated (plastic or cloth covered or

Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.
We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.

wound on an iron piece. The coil acts
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.

ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS
CHAPTER
Electricity
lectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable
and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,
hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does
it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate
the current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt
to answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of
electric current and its applications.
We are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing
water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge
flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we
say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we
know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide
flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We
have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What
does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and
the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an
electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the
torch is turned off ), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.
How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by
the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In
other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using
metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons
were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first
observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive
charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the
direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the
direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the
flow of electrons, which are negative charges.
time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is
I = The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to
the charge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that an
electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric
current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the
French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is
constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,
An instrument called ammeter measures electric
current in a circuit. It is always connected in series
in a circuit through which the current is to be
measured. Figure 12.1 shows the schematic
diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a
cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.
Note that the electric current flows in the circuit
from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative
terminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

‘Flow’ of charges inside a wire
How does a metal conduct electricity? You would think that a low-energy electron
would have great difficulty passing through a solid conductor. Inside the solid, the
atoms are packed together with very little spacing between them. But it turns out
that the electrons are able to ‘travel’ through a perfect solid crystal smoothly and
easily, almost as if they were in a vacuum. The ‘motion’ of electrons in a conductor,
however, is very different from that of charges in empty space. When a steady current
flows through a conductor, the electrons in it move with a certain average ‘drift speed’.
One can calculate this drift speed of electrons for a typical copper wire carrying a
small current, and it is found to be actually very small, of the order of 1 mm s-1. How
is it then that an electric bulb lights up as soon as we turn the switch on? It cannot be
that a current starts only when an electron from one terminal of the electric supply
physically reaches the other terminal through the bulb, because the physical drift of
electrons in the conducting wires is a very slow process. The exact mechanism of the
current flow, which takes place with a speed close to the speed of light, is fascinating,
but it is beyond the scope of this book. Do you feel like probing this question at an
advanced level?
What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of
flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as
water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube
is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a
pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of
the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic
wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only
if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –
along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a
battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within
a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,
even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a
conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in
motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to
maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its
chemical energy stored in it.
We define the electric potential difference between two points in an
electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit
charge from one point to the other –
Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W )/Charge (Q)
V = W/Q
The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after
Alessandro Volta (1745 –1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the

when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one

Therefore, 1 volt =
The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the
points between which the potential difference is to be measured.
Example 12.2
How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points
having a potential difference 12 V?
Solution
The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential
difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in
moving the charge [from Eq. (12.2)] is

and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor
is 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 ampere
Also from Eq. (12.5) we get
I = V/R
It is obvious from Eq. (12.7) that the current through a resistor is
inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the
current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase
or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to
regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable
resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used
to change the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical
resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.
Activity 12.2
Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug
key and some connecting wires.
Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter
leaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 12.4.
Complete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY. Plug the key. Note
down the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note: Always take out the key
from the plug after measuring the current through the circuit.]
Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through it by
measuring the reading of the ammeter.
Now repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY.
Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?
What do the above observations indicate?
You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the
ammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.
In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different
components. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path
for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know

current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a
conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among
which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is
retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low
resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable
resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a
higher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers
even higher resistance.

Activity 12.3
Complete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length l
[say, marked (1)] and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 12.5.
Now, plug the key. Note the current in the ammeter.
Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the
length, that is 2l [marked (2) in the Fig. 12.5].
Note the ammeter reading.
Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire, of the same length l [marked (3)]. A
thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the
circuit.
Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 12.5] in the circuit.
Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the first nichrome
wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.
Notice the difference in the current in all cases.
Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?
Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?
It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when
the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when
a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the
circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different
material of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.
On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (12.5) – (12.7)], we observe that the

have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly
proportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of
cross-section (A). That is,
R∝l and R ∝ 1/A
Combining Eqs. (12.8) and (12.9) we get
R∝ or, R=ρ where ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical
resistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is
Ω m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys
have very low resistivity in the range of 10–8 Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. They are
good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have
resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and
resistivity of a material vary with temperature.
Table 12.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher
than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily
at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in
electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used
almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and
aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

if the resistance of the bulb filament is 1200 Ω? (b) How much
current will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if
the resistance of the heater coil is 100 Ω?
Solution
From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/1200 Ω = 0.18 A.
From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 Ω = 2.2 A.
Note the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric
heater from the same 220 V source!
Example 12.4
The potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater
is 60 V when it draws a current of 4 A from the source. What
current will the heater draw if the potential difference is increased
to 120 V?
Solution
We are given, potential difference V = 60 V, current I = 4 A.
= 15 Ω .
When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is
given by
According to Ohm’s law, R =
current =

The current through the heater becomes 8 A.
Example 12.5
Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Ω at 20°C. If the
diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the
metal at that temperature? Using Table 12.2, predict the material
of the wire.
Solution
We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Ω, the diameter
d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.
Therefore, from Eq. (12.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is
ρ = (RA/l ) = (R πd2/4l )
Substitution of values in this gives
= 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m
The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m. From
Table 12.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.
Science
A wire of given material having length l and area of cross-section A
has a resistance of 4 Ω. What would be the resistance of another wire
of the same material having length l/2 and area of cross-section 2A?
Solution
For first wire
R1 = ρ
= 4Ω Now for second wire
R2 = ρ
l /2 R2 = R1 R 2= 1Ω
The resistance of the new wire is 1Ω.
On what factors does the resistance of a conductor depend?
Will current flow more easily through a thick wire or a thin wire of the
same material, when connected to the same source? Why?
Let the resistance of an electrical component remains constant while
the potential difference across the two ends of the component decreases
to half of its former value. What change will occur in the current through
it? Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of an alloy
rather than a pure metal?
Use the data in Table 12.2 to answer the following –
ANCE OF A SYSTEM OF RESISTORS
RESISTANCE
In preceding sections, we learnt about some simple electric circuits. We
have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its
resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical
gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore
intend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.
There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 12.6
shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,
R2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said
to be connected in series.
Electricity
are connected together between points X and Y. Here, the resistors are
said to be connected in parallel.
What happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are
connected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent
resistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following
activities.
Activity 12.4
Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them
with a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 12.6.
You may use the resistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a
battery of 6 V for performing this Activity.
Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.
Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the
resistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.
Do you find any change in the value of current through the
ammeter?
Science
same, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in
a series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of
the circuit or the same current through each resistor.
Activity 12.5
In Activity 12.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the
series combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 12.6.
Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It
gives the potential difference across the series combination of
resistors. Let it be V. Now measure the potential difference across
the two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.
Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter. Now insert
the voltmeter across the ends X and P of the first resistor, as
shown in Fig. 12.8.
Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first
resistor. Let it be V1.
Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two
resistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.
Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.
You will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of
potential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference
across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential
difference across the individual resistors. That is,
V = V1 + V2 + V3
In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 12.8, let I be the current through
the circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to
replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor
of resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and the
current I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law
to the entire circuit, we have
V=IR Electricity
have V1 = I R1
[12.13(a)]
and V2 = I R2
[12.13(b)]
V3 = I R3
[12.13(c)]
From Eq. (12.11),
I R = I R1 + I R2 + I R3
or Rs = R1 +R2 + R3
We can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the
resistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual
resistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.
Example 12.7
An electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ω
resistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 12.9). Calculate (a) the
total resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and
a resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V battery
Solution
The resistance of electric lamp, R 1 = 20 Ω,
The resistance of the conductor connected in series, R 2 = 4 Ω.
Then the total resistance in the circuit
R = R1 + R2
Rs = 20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.
The total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery
V = 6 V.
Now by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by
I = V/Rs
= 6 V/24 Ω
= 0.25 A.
Science
we get potential difference across the electric lamp,
V1 = 20 Ω × 0.25 A
= 5 V;
and, that across the conductor, V2 = 4 Ω × 0.25 A
= 1 V.
Suppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric
lamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance
must be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery
terminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance
R of this equivalent resistor would be
R = V/I
= 6 V/ 0.25 A
= 24 Ω.
This is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum
of the two resistances.
Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three
cells of 2 V each, a 5 Ω resistor, an 8 Ω resistor, and a 12 Ω resistor, and
a plug key, all connected in series.
Redraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure
the current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure the
potential difference across the 12 Ω resistor. What would be the readings
in the ammeter and the voltmeter?
Now, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel
with a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.12.7.
Activity 12.6
Make a parallel combination, XY, of three
resistors having resistances R1, R2, and R3,
respectively. Connect it with a battery, a
plug key and an ammeter, as shown in
parallel with the combination of resistors.
Plug the key and note the ammeter reading.
Let the current be I. Also take the voltmeter
reading. It gives the potential difference V,
across the combination. The potential
difference across each resistor is also V. This
can be checked by connecting the voltmeter
across each individual resistor (see
Electricity
Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.
Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 12.11. Note the ammeter
reading, I1.
Similarly, measure the currents through R 2 and R 3. Let these be I 2 and I 3, respectively.
What is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3 ?
It is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the
separate currents through each branch of the combination.
I = I1 + I2 + I3
Let Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of
resistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,
we have
I = V/Rp
On applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have
I1 = V /R1; I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3
From Eqs. (12.15) to (12.17), we have
V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3
or Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance
of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the
reciprocals of the individual resistances.
Example 12.8
In the circuit diagram given in Fig. 12.10, suppose the resistors R1,
R2 and R 3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which have
been connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current through
each resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit
resistance.
Solution
R1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.
Potential difference across the battery, V = 12 V.
This is also the potential difference across each of the individual
resistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use
Ohm’s law.
The current I1, through R1 =
V/ R1
I1 = 12 V/5 Ω =
Science
= V/ R2
I2 = 12 V/10 Ω = 1.2 A.
The current I3, through R3
= V/R3
I3 = 12 V/30 Ω = 0.4 A.
The total current in the circuit,
I = I1 + I2 + I3
= (2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A
= 4A The total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq. (12.18)]
= + R p 5 10 30 3
Thus, Rp = 3 Ω.
Example 12.9
If in Fig. 12.12, R 1 = 10 Ω, R2 = 40 Ω, R3 = 30 Ω, R4 = 20 Ω, R5 = 60 Ω,
and a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate
in the circuit.
Solution
Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R 2 by an
equivalent resistor of resistance, R ′. Similarly we replace
the parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single
resistor of resistance R ″. Then using Eq. (12.18), we have
= 5/40; that is R′ = 8 Ω.
Similarly,
that is, R″ = 10 Ω.
Thus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.
To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get
I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.
We have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant throughout
the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric
bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely
different values to operate properly (see Example 12.3). Another major
disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is
broken and none of the components works. If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to
decorate buildings on festivals, on marriage celebrations etc., you might have
seen the electrician spending lot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the
‘dead’ bulb – each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the
other hand, a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets.
The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (12.18). This
is helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and requires
different current to operate properly.

HEATING
TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The
chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between
its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current
through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We
have also seen, in Section 12.2, that to maintain the current, the source
has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of
the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into
useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the
source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of
gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric
fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other
hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of
resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets
dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating
effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric
heater, electric iron etc.
Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let
the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 12.13). Let t be the time during
which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q
through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply
energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the
source is
P=V = VI Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,
that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This
energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady
current I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is
H = VIt
Science
H = I2 Rt
This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The
law implies that heat produced in a resistor is
for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to
resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly
proportional to the time for which the current flows
through the resistor. In practical situations, when
an electric appliance is connected to a known
voltage source, Eq. (12.21) is used after
calculating the current through it, using the
relation I = V/R.
A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit
Example 12.10
An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating
is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the
minimum. The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the
resistance in each case?
Solution
From Eq. (12.19), we know that the power input is
P=VI Thus the current I = P/V
I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.
I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.
Example 12.11
potential difference across the resistor.
Solution
H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?
From Eq. (12.21) we have the current through the resistor as
√(H/Rt)
√[100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]
Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (12.5)] is

Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element
does?
Compute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge
in one hour through a potential difference of 50 V.
An electric iron of resistance 20 Ω takes a current of 5 A. Calculate the
heat developed in 30 s.
Electric Current
The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of
electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical
energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase
the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However,
heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric
laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater
are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s heating.
The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric
bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is
possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such
high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as
tungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The
filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using
insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically
inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of
the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part
of it is in the form of light radiated.
Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in
electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow
of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with
the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of
appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead
etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,
the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and
breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of
porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic
purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron
which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current
of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A
fuse must be used.
Science
You have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is
power. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.
Equation (12.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated
or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.
The power P is given by
P = VI
P = I2R = V2/R
Or The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by
a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference
of 1 V. Thus,
More to Know!
The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a
much larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical
energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,
therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when
is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.
= 3.6 × 106 watt second
= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)
Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!
We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons
through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energy
that we use.

An electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is

the cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h?
Electricity
The total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be
= 96 kW h
Thus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is

the motor and the energy consumed in 2 h.
What you have learnt
A stream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current.
Conventionally, the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of
electrons.
The SI unit of electric current is ampere.
To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit, we use a cell or a battery. A cell
generates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V).
Resistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls
the magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω).
Ohm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly
proportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.
The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of
cross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.
The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of
their individual resistances.

effects of electric current. What could be the other effects of electric
current? We know that an electric current-carrying wire behaves like a
magnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it.
Activity 13.1
Take a straight thick copper wire and place it
between the points X and Y in an electric circuit,
as shown in Fig. 13.1. The wire XY is kept
perpendicular to the plane of paper.
Horizontally place a small compass near to this
copper wire. See the position of its needle.
Pass the current through the circuit by
inserting the key into the plug.
Observe the change in the position of the
compass needle.
Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric
current through a metallic conductor
We see that the needle is deflected. What does it mean? It means that
the electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic
effect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each
other. Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of
moving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such
electromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets and
electric motors which involve the magnetic effect of electric current, and
electric generators which involve the electric effect of moving magnets.
Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
Hans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th
century, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism.
In 1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected
when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and
magnetism were related phenomena. His research later created
technologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of
magnetic field strength is named the Oersted in his honor.
We are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected when
brought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar
magnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards
seeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called
south seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed
that like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.
Why does a compass needle get deflected when brought near
a bar magnet?
Activity 13.2
Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing
board using some adhesive material.
Place a bar magnet in the centre of it.
Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly
around the bar magnet (Fig. 13.2). A
salt-sprinkler may be used for this
purpose.
Now tap the board gently.
What do you observe?
Iron filings near the bar magnet align
themselves along the field lines.
The iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown
this pattern demonstrate? The magnet exerts its influence in the region
surrounding it. Therefore the iron filings experience a force. The force
thus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region
surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,
is said to have a magnetic field. The lines along which the iron filings
align themselves represent magnetic field lines.
Are there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar
magnet? Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.
Activity 13.3
Take a small compass and a bar magnet.
Place the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing
board, using some adhesive material.
Mark the boundary of the magnet.
Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet. How does
it behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north
pole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed
away from the north pole of the magnet.
Science
Mark the position of two ends of the needle.
Now move the needle to a new position
such that its south pole occupies the
position previously occupied by its north
pole.
In this way, proceed step by step till you
reach the south pole of the magnet as
shown in Fig. 13.3.
Join the points marked on the paper by a
smooth curve. This curve represents
a field line.
Repeat the above procedure and draw as
many lines as you can. You will get a
pattern shown in Fig. 13.4. These lines
represent the magnetic field around the
magnet. These are known as magnetic
field lines.
Observe the deflection in the compass
The deflection increases as the needle is
moved towards the poles.
Drawing a magnetic field line with the help of a
compass needle
Field lines around a bar magnet
Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.
The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a
by convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at
the south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 13.4).
Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its
The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of
closeness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting
on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are
crowded (see Fig. 13.4).
No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would
mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point
towards two directions, which is not possible.

MAGNETIC
CURRENT--C ARRYING
CONDUCTOR
In Activity 13.1, we have seen that an electric current through a
metallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to
find the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the
following way –
Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect
all of them in series as shown in Fig. 13.5 (a).
Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.
Plug the key in the circuit.
Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from
towards the east.
Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 13.5 (b). This would result in
the change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to
Observe the change in the direction of deflection of the needle. You will see that now the
the direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.
Conductor
What determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current
through a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the
conductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.
We shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around a
straight conductor carrying current.
Activity 13.5
Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an
ammeter (0–5 A), a plug key, and a long straight thick copper
wire.
Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a
rectangular cardboard. Take care that the cardboard is fixed and
does not slide up or down.
Science
Connect the copper wire vertically between the
points X and Y, as shown in Fig. 13.6 (a), in
series with the battery, a plug and key.
Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the
cardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this
purpose.)
Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed
position and note the current through the
ammeter.
Close the key so that a current flows through
the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed
between the points X and Y remains vertically
straight.
Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe
the patter n of the iron filings. You would find
that the iron filings align themselves showing
a pattern of concentric circles around the
copper wire (Fig. 13.6).
What do these concentric circles represent?
They represent the magnetic field lines.
How can the direction of the magnetic field be
found? Place a compass at a point (say P) over
a circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The
direction of the north pole of the compass
produced by the electric current through the
straight wire at point P. Show the direction by
an arrow.
Does the direction of magnetic field lines get
reversed if the direction of current through the
straight copper wire is reversed? Check it.
Variable

the field lines of a magnetic field around a
straight conducting wire. The arrows in the
circles show the direction of the field lines.
What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a
given point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary
the current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also
changes. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.
It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given
point increases as the current through the wire increases.
What happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved
from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the same?
To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the conducting
wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see that the
deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field produced by
a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it
increases. From Fig. 13.6, it can be noticed that the concentric circles
representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight wire
become larger and larger as we move away from it.
A convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated
with a current-carrying conductor is –
Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards
the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the
conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as
shown in Fig. 13.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.
Example 13.1
A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west
direction. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly
below it and at a point directly above it?
Right-hand thumb rule
Solution
The current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand
thumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or
above the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,
when viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed
from the west end.
Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.
List the properties of magnetic lines of force.
Why don’t two magnetic lines of force intersect each other?
Circular Loop
Magnetic field lines of the field
produced by a current-carrying
circular loop
We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines
produced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose
this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a
current is passed through it. How would the magnetic field
lines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced
by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the
distance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying
circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic
field around it would become larger and larger as we move
away from the wire (Fig. 13.8). By the time we reach at the
centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would
appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying
current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as
straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right
hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire
contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction
within the loop.
* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a
corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the corkscrew is the
direction of the magnetic field.
Science
wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is
current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to
each turn then just adds up.
Activity 13.6
Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.
Insert a circular coil having large number of turns
through them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.
Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,
a key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 13.9.
Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.
Plug the key.
Tap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the
pattern of the iron filings that emerges on the
cardboard.
Magnetic field produced by a currentcarrying circular coil.
A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped
closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern
of the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is
shown in Fig. 13.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the
magnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 13.4). Do they look
similar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid
behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the
south pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of
parallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is
the same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is
uniform inside the solenoid.
A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be
used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,
when placed inside the coil (Fig. 13.11). The magnet so formed is
called an electromagnet.
Consider a circular loop of wire lying in
the plane of the table. Let the current
pass through the loop clockwise. Apply
the right-hand rule to find out the
direction of the magnetic field inside
and outside the loop.
The magnetic field in a given region is
uniform. Draw a diagram to represent it.

is the same at all points.
CURRENT-- C ARRYING CONDUCTOR
IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
We have learnt that an electric current flowing through a conductor
produces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on a
magnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre
Marie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert
an equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force
due to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be
demonstrated through the following activity.
Activity 13.7
Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using
two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a
stand, as shown in Fig. 13.12.
Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that
the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic
field directed upwards. For this put the north pole of
the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically
above the aluminium rod (Fig. 13.12).
Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,
a key and a rheostat.
Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from
end B to end A.
What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is
displaced towards the left. You will notice that the r od
gets displaced.
Reverse the direction of current flowing through the
rod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is
Why does the rod get displaced?
A current-carrying rod, AB, experiences
a force perpendicular to its length and
the magnetic field.
The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a
force is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed
in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also
reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.
Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by
interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that
Science
shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the
direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments
have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude
of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles
to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a
simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.
In Activity 13.7, we considered the
direction of the current and that of the magnetic
field perpendicular to each other and found
that the force is perpendicular to both of them.
The three directions can be illustrated through
a simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.
According to this rule, stretch the thumb,
forefinger and middle finger of your left hand
such that they are mutually perpendicular

finger in the direction of current, then the

Devices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields
include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones
and measuring instruments. In the next few sections we shall study
about electric motors and generators.
Example 13.2
An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown
in Fig. 13.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be
Solution
Answer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the
direction of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand
rule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction
of motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.

Magnetism in medicine
An electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents that
travel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch
something, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This
impulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are about
one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human body where
the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The magnetic field
inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body parts. This is
done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis of these
images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses in medicine.
A simple electric motor
An electric motor is a rotating device that converts electrical energy to
mechanical energy. Electric motor is used as an important component
in electric fans, refrigerators, mixers, washing machines, computers, MP3
players etc. Do you know how an electric motor works?
An electric motor, as shown in Fig. 13.15, consists of a rectangular
coil ABCD of insulated copper wire. The coil is placed between the two
poles of a magnetic field such that the arm AB and CD are perpendicular
to the direction of the magnetic field. The
ends of the coil are connected to the two
halves P and Q of a split ring. The inner sides
of these halves are insulated and attached
to an axle. The external conducting edges of
P and Q touch two conducting stationary
brushes X and Y, respectively, as shown in
the Fig. 13.15.
Current in the coil ABCD enters from the
source battery through conducting brush
X and flows back to the battery through
brush Y. Notice that the current in arm AB
of the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it
flows from C to D, that is, opposite to the
direction of current through arm AB. On
applying Fleming’s left hand rule for the
direction of force on a current-carrying
Science
acting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm
CD pushes it upwards. Thus the coil and the axle O, mounted free to
turn about an axis, rotate anti-clockwise. At half rotation, Q makes
contact with the brush X and P with brush Y. Therefore the current in
the coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. A device that
reverses the direction of flow of current through a circuit is called a
commutator. In electric motors, the split ring acts as a commutator. The
reversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two
arms AB and CD. Thus the arm AB of the coil that was earlier pushed
down is now pushed up and the arm CD previously pushed up is now
pushed down. Therefore the coil and the axle rotate half a turn more in
the same direction. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half
rotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle.
The commercial motors use (i) an electromagnet in place of permanent
magnet; (ii) large number of turns of the conducting wire in the currentcarrying coil; and (iii) a soft iron core on which the coil is wound. The
soft iron core, on which the coil is wound, plus the coils, is called an
armature. This enhances the power of the motor.
State Fleming’s left-hand rule.
What is the principle of an electric motor?
What is the role of the split ring in an electric motor?
We have studied that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a
magnetic field such that the direction of current is perpendicular to the
magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force causes the conductor to
move. Now let us imagine a situation in which a conductor is moving
inside a magnetic field or a magnetic field is changing around a fixed
conductor. What will happen? This was first studied by English physicist
Michael Faraday. In 1831, Faraday made an important breakthrough
by discovering how a moving magnet can be used to generate electric
currents. To observe this effect, let us perform the following activity.
Activity 13.8
Take a coil of wire AB having a large number of turns.
Connect the ends of the coil to a galvanometer as shown in
Take a strong bar magnet and move its north pole towards the
end B of the coil. Do you find any change in the galvanometer
Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
There is a momentary deflection in the needle of
the galvanometer, say to the right. This indicates
the presence of a current in the coil AB. The
deflection becomes zero the moment the motion
of the magnet stops.
Now withdraw the north pole of the magnet away
from the coil. Now the galvanometer is deflected
toward the left, showing that the current is now
set up in the direction opposite to the first.
Place the magnet stationary at a point near to
the coil, keeping its north pole towards the end
B of the coil. We see that the galvanometer needle
deflects toward the right when the coil is moved
towards the north pole of the magnet. Similarly
the needle moves toward left when the coil is
moved away.
When the coil is kept stationary with respect to
the magnet, the deflection of the galvanometer
drops to zero. What do you conclude from this
activity?
Moving a magnet towards a coil sets up a
current in the coil circuit, as indicated by
deflection in the galvanometer needle.
A galvanometer is an instrument that can detect
the presence of a current in a circuit. The pointer
remains at zero (the centre of the scale) for zero
current flowing through it. It can deflect either
to the left or to the right of the zero mark
depending on the direction of current.
You can also check that if you had moved south pole of the magnet
towards the end B of the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer would
just be opposite to the previous case. When the coil and the magnet are
both stationary, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. It is, thus,
clear from this activity that motion of a magnet with respect to the coil
produces an induced potential difference, which sets up an induced
electric current in the circuit.
Michael Faraday (1791–1867)
Michael Faraday was an experimental physicist. He had no formal
education. He worked in a book-binding shop during his early years.
He used to read books that came for binding. This way Faraday
developed his interest in science. He got an opportunity to listen to
some public lectures by Humphrey Davy of Royal Institute. He made
careful notes of Davy’s lectures and sent them to Davy. Soon he was
made an assistant in Davy’s laboratory at the Royal Institute. Faraday
made several path-breaking discoveries that include electromagnetic
induction and the laws of electrolysis. Several universities conferred
on him the honorary degrees but he turned down such honours. Faraday loved his
science work more than any honour.
Science
magnet is replaced by a current-carrying coil and the current in the coil
can be varied.
Activity 13.9
Take two different coils of copper wire having
large number of turns (say 50 and 100 turns
respectively). Insert them over a non-conducting
cylindrical r oll, as shown in Fig. 13.17. (You may
use a thick paper roll for this purpose.)
Connect the coil-1, having larger number of
turns, in series with a battery and a plug key.
Also connect the other coil-2 with a
galvanometer as shown.
Plug in the key. Observe the galvanometer. Is
there a deflection in its needle? You will observe
that the needle of the galvanometer instantly
jumps to one side and just as quickly returns to
zero, indicating a momentary current in coil-2.
Disconnect coil-1 from the battery. You will
observe that the needle momentarily moves, but
to the opposite side. It means that now the
current flows in the opposite direction in coil-2.
Current is induced in coil-2 when current
in coil-1 is changed
In this activity we observe that as soon as the current in coil-1 reaches
either a steady value or zero, the galvanometer in coil-2 shows no
deflection.
From these observations, we conclude that a potential difference is
induced in the coil-2 whenever the electric current through the coil–1
is changing (starting or stopping). Coil-1 is called the primary coil and
coil-2 is called the secondary coil. As the current in the first coil changes,
the magnetic field associated with it also changes. Thus the magnetic
field lines around the secondary coil also change. Hence the change in
magnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of
induced electric current in it. This process, by which a changing
magnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor,
is called electromagnetic induction. In practice we can induce current
in a coil either by moving it in a magnetic field or by changing the
magnetic field around it. It is convenient in most situations to move
the coil in a magnetic field.
The induced current is found to be the highest when
the direction of motion of the coil is at right angles to the
magnetic field. In this situation, we can use a simple rule
to know the direction of the induced current. Stretch the
thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand so that
they are perpendicular to each other, as shown in
magnetic field and the thumb shows the direction of motion
of conductor, then the middle finger will show the direction
of induced current. This simple rule is called Fleming’s
Fleming’s right-hand rule

Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
Explain different ways to induce current in a coil.
ATOR GENERA
Illustration of the
principle of electric
generator
Based on the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, the experiments
studied above generate induced current, which is usually very small.
This principle is also employed to produce large currents for use in homes
and industry. In an electric generator, mechanical energy is used to rotate
a conductor in a magnetic field to produce electricity.
An electric generator, as shown in Fig. 13.19, consists of a rotating
rectangular coil ABCD placed between the two poles of a permanent
magnet. The two ends of this coil are connected to
the two rings R1 and R2. The inner side of these
rings are made insulated. The two conducting
stationary brushes B1 and B2 are kept pressed
separately on the rings R1 and R2, respectively. The
two rings R1 and R2 are internally attached to an
axle. The axle may be mechanically rotated from
outside to rotate the coil inside the magnetic field.
Outer ends of the two brushes are connected to
the galvanometer to show the flow of current in the
given external circuit.
When the axle attached to the two rings is
rotated such that the arm AB moves up (and the
arm CD moves down) in the magnetic field produced
by the permanent magnet. Let us say the coil ABCD
is rotated clockwise in the arrangement shown in Fig. 13.19. By applying
Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced currents are set up in these arms
along the directions AB and CD. Thus an induced current flows in the
direction ABCD. If there are larger numbers of turns in the coil, the current
generated in each turn adds up to give a large current through the coil.
This means that the current in the external circuit flows from B2 to B1.
After half a rotation, arm CD starts moving up and AB moving down.
As a result, the directions of the induced currents in both the arms
change, giving rise to the net induced current in the direction DCBA.
The current in the external circuit now flows from B1 to B2. Thus after
every half rotation the polarity of the current in the respective arms
changes. Such a current, which changes direction after equal intervals
of time, is called an alternating current (abbreviated as AC). This device
is called an AC generator.
To get a direct current (DC, which does not change its direction with
time), a split-ring type commutator must be used. With this arrangement,
one brush is at all times in contact with the arm moving up in the field,
while the other is in contact with the arm moving down. We have seen
the working of a split ring commutator in the case of an electric motor
Science
is thus called a DC generator.
The difference between the direct and alternating currents is that the
direct current always flows in one direction, whereas the alternating
current reverses its direction periodically. Most power stations
constructed these days produce AC. In India, the AC changes direction
after every 1/100 second, that is, the frequency of AC is 50 Hz. An
important advantage of AC over DC is that electric power can be
transmitted over long distances without much loss of energy.
State the principle of an electric generator.
Name some sources of direct current.

In our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply
by underground cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually with
red insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with
black insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the
potential difference between the two is 220 V.
At the metre-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity
meter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected
to the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate
circuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of
geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for
bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is
usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.
This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that
have a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,
refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which
provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it
ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance
keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe
electric shock.
Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be
connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a
separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order
that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected
parallel to each other.
Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We
have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous
chapter (see Section 12.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the
appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur
when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This
occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the
appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly
increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse
prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage
by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating
that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.
Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply
voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many
appliances to a single socket.

appliances.

Science
A compass needle is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards north, is
called a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a
south pole.
A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of
the magnet can be detected.
Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along
which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the
magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that
point would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is
greater.
A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.
The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction
is given by the right-hand rule.
The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current
flowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of a
solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.
An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of
insulated copper wire.
A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.
If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to
each other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both
and will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule. This is the basis of an electric motor.
An electric motor is a device that converts electric energy into mechanical energy.
The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced current
in a coil placed in a region where the magnetic field changes with time. The magnetic
field may change due to a relative motion between the coil and a magnet placed
magnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the
conductor or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. The
direction of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s right-hand rule.
A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It works on the basis
of electromagnetic induction.
In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One
of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of
black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two
is 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected
to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that
any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.
Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to
short-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.

Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
Chapter One
ELECTRIC CHARGES
AND FIELDS
All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when
we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather.
This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree. Have
you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another
common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the
sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric
shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a
bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is
discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated
due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that
this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we
are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything
that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the
study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges.
Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with
wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,
around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word
elektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which
on rubbing could attract light objects
like straw, pith balls and bits of papers.
You can perform the following activity
at home to experience such an effect.
Cut out long thin strips of white paper
and lightly iron them. Take them near a
TV screen or computer monitor. You will
see that the strips get attracted to the
screen. In fact they remain stuck to the
screen for a while.
It was observed that if two glass rods
rubbed with wool or silk cloth are
brought close to each other, they repel
each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands
FIGURE 1.1 Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and
of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with
unlike charges attract each other.
which the rods were rubbed, also repel
each other. However, the glass rod and
wool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s
fur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other
hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk
or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.
If a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls
thread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled
by the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a
glass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a
pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with
plastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f )].
These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts
and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many
careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of
an entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like
glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire
an electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested
that there are two kinds of electrification and we find that (i) like charges
repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The experiments also
demonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith
balls on contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged
by contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is
called the polarity of charge.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of
charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for
any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified
glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they
objects as they did on being electrified.
Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged
bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these
observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects

as positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.
We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of
the same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the
philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention,
the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic
rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it
is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be
electrically neutral.
UNIFICATION
OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
In olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity
dealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism
described interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish
scientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current
through a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation
by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets
generate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell
and the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the
interdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism. Most of the
phenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually
every force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the
matter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living
organisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the
fundamental forces of nature.
Maxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism
as Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued
that light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely
electric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately
related to that of electricity and magnetism.
The science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological
civilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety
of the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science.
Although charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the
frame of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You
know that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance
between the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as
the square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter
that electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force
by several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).
A simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf
electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a
box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged
object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to
the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of
the amount of charge.
Students can make a simple electroscope as
follows [Fig. 1.2(b)]: Take a thin aluminium curtain
rod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain. Cut
out a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at
one end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle
that can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the
opening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork
sufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the
rod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on
the lower side and ball end projecting above the cork.
Fold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in
length) in the middle and attach it to the flattened
end of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves
of your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with
about 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork.
A paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance
to measure the separation of leaves. The separation
is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the
electroscope.
To understand how the electroscope works, use
the white paper strips we used for seeing the
attraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half
so that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and

electroscope, (b) Schematics of a simple

electroscope.
You would notice that the two halves move apart.
This shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold
it into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each
other. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the
curtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is
transferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the
halves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The
divergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let
us first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.
You know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules.
Although normally the materials are electrically neutral, they do contain
charges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the
molecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive
force of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically
electrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles.
Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each
and every field associated with our life. It is therefore essential that we
learn more about such a force.
To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of
FIGURE 1.3 Paper strip charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this
experiment.
excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids, some of the electrons, being
less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred
from one body to the other. A body can thus be charged positively by
losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively
and Fields
by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the
electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets
positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is
created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are
transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the
material body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material
body can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when
a body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why
we have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing
the bodies.
AND INSULATORS
A metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of
being charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is
rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.
Suppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and
the other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the
pith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated
with a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take
place from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge
Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them,
others do not. Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily
are called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are
comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal
bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,
porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of
electricity through them. They are called insulators. Most substances
fall into one of the two classes stated above*.
When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets
distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some
charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn
why this happens in the next chapter.
This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb
gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article
like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the
ground as both are conductors of electricity.
When we bring a charged body in contact with the earth, all the
excess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current
to pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our
body). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called
grounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical
circuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth
and thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are used in buildings
for the purpose of earthing near the mains supply. The electric wiring in
our houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry
* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the
movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and
insulators.
electric current from the power station and the third is earthed by
connecting it to the buried metal plate. Metallic bodies of the electric
appliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the
earth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body,
the charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without
causing any injury to the humans; this would have otherwise been
unavoidable since the human body is a conductor of electricity.
FIGURE 1.4 Charging
by induction.
BY INDUCTION
When we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the
gets charged. Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled
by the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely
charged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is a question
we have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be
happening by performing the following experiment.
in contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a).
care that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres
are attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge
on the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in
the metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the
surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an
excess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an
excess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres
have accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge
starts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled
by these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of
force of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the
accumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation.
The process is called induction of charge and happens almost
instantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown,
till the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the
charges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to
their original neutral state.
held near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found
to be oppositely charged and attract each other.
shown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The
charges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in
In this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely
charged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod
does not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by
contact.
When electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect
takes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of
the objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.
and Fields
[This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The
mechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and
know that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However,
the magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges
and in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion.
As a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are
pulled towards the rods.
Example 1.1 How can you charge a metal sphere positively without
touching it?
Interactive animation on charging a two-sphere system by induction:
http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/estatics/itsn.cfm
Solution Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an
insulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the
metallic sphere, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b). As the rod is brought close
to the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to
repulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes
positively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge
distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the
metal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting
wire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges
at the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of
the negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect
the sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be
held at the near end [Fig. 1.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The
positive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in
FIGURE 1.5
EXAMPLE 1.1
In this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process
of induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge.
Similar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively
by induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this
case the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the
sphere is connected to the ground with a wire. Can you explain why?
OF ELECTRIC CHARGE
We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and
describe some other properties of the electric charge.
If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the
distances between them, we treat them as point charges. All the
charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point
in space.
We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall
follow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can
be done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q1 and q2,
the total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically
q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like
the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, …, qn, then
the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn . Charge has
magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one
difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive
whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to
be used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the
total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5,
in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the
same unit.
We have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by
rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new
charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric
charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When
we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.
Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to
interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is
found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.
Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.
It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated
system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed
in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns
into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have
equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after
the creation.
Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples
of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always
given by
q = ne
and Fields
where n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the
charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an
electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written
as –e and that on a proton as +e.
The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed
as quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics
where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge
was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by
English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by
Millikan in 1912.
In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a
coulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms
the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent
chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing
through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2 of Class
XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of
charge is
e = 1.602192 × 10–19 C
Thus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of –1C. In
electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered
and hence we use smaller units 1 µC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC
If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe,
all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a
body contains n1 electrons and n 2 protons, the total amount of charge on
the body is n 2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n 2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2 are integers, their
difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an
integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e.
The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic
level, we deal with charges of a few µC. At this scale the fact that charge of
a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,
the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.
This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points
and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to
us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to
each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many
small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge
distribution.
At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous
compared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge
of magnitude, say 1 µC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic
charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in
units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous
values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no
practical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic
level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds
of e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and
quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale
involved that is very important.
EXAMPLE 1.2
Example 1.2 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body
every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C
on the other body?
Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore
the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated
to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365 × 24 ×
from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will
unit for many practical purposes.
It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of
electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.
A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 10 24
electrons.
EXAMPLE 1.3
Example 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a
cup of water?
Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is
molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.
Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen
atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and
total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to
Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two
point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller
than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the
charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the
force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as
the square of the distance between the charges and was directly
proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and
acted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges
q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the
force (F) between them is given by
q1 q 2
r2 How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb
used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic
F =k * A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later
by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,
to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.

spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much
larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres
may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges
on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then
could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb
thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge
on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact
with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread
over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each
sphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get
charges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a
fixed pair of charges and measured the force for different
separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping
the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for

two charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge q.
Since force is a vector, it is better to write
Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the
position vectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2
respectively [see Fig.1.6(a)]. We denote force on
q 1 due to q2 by F12 and force on q2 due to q 1 by
F21. The two point charges q 1 and q 2 have been

r21 = r2 – r1
In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to
r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21
The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is
denoted by r 21 and r 12 , respectively (r 12 = r21). The
direction of a vector is specified by a unit vector
along the vector. To denote the direction from 1
to 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:

Coulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q 2 located at
r1 and r2, respectively is then expressed as
F21 =

• Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or
like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along – r$ 21(= r$ 12),
which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do
charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.6(b)].
The force F12 on charge q1 due to charge q2, is obtained from Eq. (1.3),
by simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,
F12 =
q1 q 2
rˆ12 = −F21
r12 Thus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.
Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and
q 2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening
space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence
of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in
matter in the next chapter.

that an electron will undergo is
a = 2.3×10–8 N / 9.11 ×10–31 kg = 2.5 × 1022 m/s2
Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we
can conclude that the effect of gravitational field is negligible on
the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations
under the action of Coulomb force due to a proton.

is noted (for example, by shining a beam of light and measuring the
deflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched
by uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.7(b).
C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a
distance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. 1.7(c).

F = identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute
on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge q/2.
Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is

of the electrostatic force on each is

F′ = MULTIPLE CHARGES
The mutual electric force between two charges is given
by Coulomb’s law. How to calculate the force on a
charge where there are not one but several charges
around? Consider a system of n stationary charges
q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum. What is the force on q1 due
to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb’s law is not enough to answer
this question. Recall that forces of mechanical origin
add according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is
the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?
Experimentally, it is verified that force on any
charge due to a number of other charges is the vector
sum of all the forces on that charge due to the other
charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces
are unaffected due to the presence of other charges.
This is termed as the principle of superposition.
To better understand the concept, consider a
system of three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in
other charges q2, q3 can therefore be obtained by
performing a vector addition of the forces due to each
one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1 due to q2
is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq. (1.3) even though
other charges are present.
r̂12 In the same way, the force on q1 due to q3, denoted
by F13, is given by
Thus, F12 =
F13 =
rˆ13 FIGURE 1.8 A system of (a) three
charges (b) multiple charges.
which again is the Coulomb force on q1 due to q3, even though other
charge q2 is present.
Thus the total force F1 on q1 due to the two charges q2 and q3 is
given as
F1 = F12 + F13 =
rˆ12 +
rˆ13 The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of
charges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.8(b).
The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,
q2, ..., qn, the force on q1 due to q2 is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,
i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q3, q4, ..., qn. The
total force F1 on the charge q1, due to all other charges, is then given by
the vector sum of the forces F12, F13, ..., F1n:
i.e.,
F1 = F12 + F13 + ...+ F1n =
q1q 3
q1qn  2 rˆ12 + 2 rˆ13 + ... + 2 rˆ1n 
r13 r1n q1 n qi
∑ r̂1i
The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of
addition of vectors. All of electrostatics is basically a consequence of
Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.
EXAMPLE 1.6
Example 1.6 Consider three charges q1, q2, q3 each equal to q at the
vertices of an equilateral triangle of side l. What is the force on a
charge Q (with the same sign as q) placed at the centroid of the
triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.9?
FIGURE 1.9
Solution In the given equilateral triangle ABC of sides of length l, if
we draw a perpendicular AD to the side BC,
AD = AC cos 30º = ( 3 /2 ) l and the distance AO of the centroid O
from A is (2/3) AD = ( 1/ 3 ) l. By symmatry AO = BO = CO.
and Fields
Thus,
Force F2 on Q due to charge q at B = 4 πε
Force F1 on Q due to charge q at A =
Qq along AO
l2 Qq along BO
l2 Force F3 on Q due to charge q at C = 4 πε 2 along CO
The resultant of forces F 2 and F 3 is 4 πε 2 along OA, by the
parallelogram law. Therefore, the total force on Q = 4 πε 2 ( rˆ − rˆ )

= 0, where r̂ is the unit vector along OA.
It is clear also by symmetry that the three forces will sum to zero.
Suppose that the resultant force was non-zero but in some direction.
Consider what would happen if the system was rotated through 60°
about O.
Example 1.7 Consider the charges q, q, and –q placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.10. What is the force on
each charge?
FIGURE 1.10
Solution The forces acting on charge q at A due to charges q at B
and –q at C are F12 along BA and F13 along AC respectively, as shown
in Fig. 1.10. By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the charge
q at A is given by
F1 = F r̂1 where r̂1 is a unit vector along BC.
The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the
q2 The total force F2 on charge q at B is thus F2 = F r̂ 2, where r̂ 2 is a
unit vector along AC.

Physics
Similarly the total force on charge –q at C is F3 = 3 F n̂ , where n̂ is
the unit vector along the direction bisecting the ∠BCA.
It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges
is zero, i.e.,
F1 + F2 + F3 = 0
The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact
that Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof
is left to you as an exercise.
Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we
place another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q
will exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If
charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there
when we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the
early scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say
that the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.
When another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on
it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q at a
point r is given as
E ( r) =
rˆ = rˆ where rˆ = r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)
specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position
vector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which
could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge
has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the
force F exerted by a charge Q on a charge q, as
F= rˆ Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the
charge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be
looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of
Q and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it
experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric
field E at the location of q. Thus,
F(r) = q E(r)
Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.
Some important remarks may be made here:
a charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the
FIGURE 1.11 Electric
electric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined

charge Q, (b) due to a

and Fields
at that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is
called a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a
source charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q
must remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought
at any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical
force due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to
make q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the
ratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:
 F E = lim  
q →0  q 
A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed
in the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!
This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.
When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a
charged planar sheet (Section 1.15), the charges on the sheet are held to
their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents
inside the sheet.
in terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because
F is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The
force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular
location of charge q which may take any value in the space around
the charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on
the space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over
the space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at
every point in three-dimensional space.
outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is
depends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,
the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the
distance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude
of its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to
a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its
centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.
Consider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with position vectors r1,
r2, ..., rn relative to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in
space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the
system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit
test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original
positions of charges q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the
superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by
position vector r.
Electric field E1 at r due to q1 at r1 is given by
E1 = r̂1P where r̂1P is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to P,
and r1P is the distance between q1 and P.
In the same manner, electric field E2 at r due to q2 at
r2 is
E2 = FIGURE 1.12 Electric field at a
point due to a system of charges is
the vector sum of the electric fields
at the point due to individual
charges.
E(r) =
r̂2P where r̂2P is a unit vector in the direction from q2 to P
and r 2P is the distance between q 2 and P. Similar
expressions hold good for fields E3, E4, ..., En due to
charges q3, q4, ..., qn.
By the superposition principle, the electric field E at r
due to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.12)
E(r) = E1 (r) + E2 (r) + … + En(r)
rˆ + rˆ2 P + ... +
rˆnP ∑ r 2i r̂i P
i =1 i P
E is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space
and is determined from the positions of the source charges.
You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced
here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity
is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this
intermediate quantity called the electric field?
For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not
really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the
electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in
the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive
test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing
the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and
is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine
the field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is
defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric
field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.
The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,
emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with timedependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force
between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest
speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another
is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot
and Fields
arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect
useful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1
produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed
c, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts
for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be
detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as
physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an
independent dynamics of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws
of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of timedependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time
and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields
transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday
and is now among the central concepts in physics.
Example 1.8 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a
uniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.13(a)]. The
direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged
and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.13(b)]. Compute
the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free
fall under gravity’.
FIGURE 1.13
Solution In Fig. 1.13(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged
electron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is
the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is
ae = eE/me
where me is the mass of the electron.
Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a
distance h is given by t e =
ae eE For e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,
E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,
te = 2.9 × 10–9s
ap = eE/mp
where mp is the mass of the proton; mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg. The time of
fall for the proton is
EXAMPLE 1.8
In Fig. 1.13 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged
proton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE . The
acceleration of the proton is
ap tp = eE = 1.3 × 10 –7 s
Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through
the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free
fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of
the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration
due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,
let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric
field:
ap = eE mp EXAMPLE 1.8
= 1.9 × 1012 m s –2
which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s –2), the
acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even
greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored
in this example.

The directions in which these two vectors point are indicated in
We have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity
and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E
due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the
origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the
electric field with their lengths proportional to the strength
of the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric
field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the
distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets
shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing
radially outward. Figure 1.15 shows such a picture. In
this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the
force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of
that arrow. Connect the arrows pointing in one direction
and the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus
get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point
charge. Have we lost the information about the strength
or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained
in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the
field is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong
the charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge, FIGURE 1.15 Field of a point charge.
the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,
resulting in well-separated lines.
Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not
important. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.
It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is
important.
We draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in twodimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes
to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the
to the lines. Since the electric field decreases as the square of
the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the
charge increases as the square of the distance, the number
of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,
whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.
We started by saying that the field lines carry information
about the direction of electric field at different points in space.
FIGURE 1.16 Dependence of
Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density

the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field
lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart
where it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines. We
can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and
S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture
cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at
these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.
To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather
the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the
area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.
Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small
transverse line element ∆l be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then
the angle subtended by ∆l at O can be approximated as ∆θ = ∆l/r.
Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small
perpendicular plane area ∆S, at a distance r, can be written as
∆Ω = ∆S/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial
field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.16, for two points P1 and P2 at distances
r1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle
∆Ω is r12 ∆Ω at P1 and an element of area r22 ∆Ω at P2, respectively. The
P1 and n/( r22 ∆Ω) at P2 , respectively. Since n and ∆Ω are common, the
strength of the field clearly has a 1/r 2 dependence.
The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an
intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around
charged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is
somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more
appropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have
adopted in this book.
Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric
field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,

This follows from the conservative nature of electric
field (Chapter 2).
Consider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small
flat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The
rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the
area per unit time v dS and represents the flux of liquid
flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is
makes an angle θ with it, the projected area in a plane
perpendicular to v is δ dS cos θ. Therefore, the flux going
out of the surface dS is v. n̂ dS. For the case of the electric
field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric
flux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a
physically observable quantity unlike the case of
liquid flow.
In the picture of electric field lines described above,
we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,
placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the
strength of electric field at that point. This means that if
FIGURE 1.17 Field lines due to
some simple charge configurations.
we place a small planar element of area ∆S
crossing it is proportional* to E ∆S. Now
suppose we tilt the area element by angle θ.
Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the
area element will be smaller. The projection of
the area element normal to E is ∆S cosθ. Thus,
the number of field lines crossing ∆S is
proportional to E ∆S cosθ. When θ = 90°, field
lines will be parallel to ∆S and will not cross it
at all (Fig. 1.18).
The orientation of area element and not
merely its magnitude is important in many
contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount
of water flowing through a ring will naturally
depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold
it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow

orientation. This shows that an area element
should be treated as a vector. It has a
magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar
area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the
plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.
How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine
dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.
Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated
with it, as explained before.
Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along
its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do
we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?
This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given
context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.
The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken
to be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used
in Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector ∆S at a point on a closed
surface equals ∆S n̂ where ∆S is the magnitude of the area element and
We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux ∆φ through
an area element ∆S is defined by
∆φ = E.∆S = E ∆S cosθ

which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting
the area element. The angle θ here is the angle between E and ∆S. For a
closed surface, with the convention stated already, θ is the angle between
E and the outward normal to the area element. Notice we could look at
the expression E ∆S cosθ in two ways: E (∆S cosθ ) i.e., E times the

and Fields
projection of area normal to E, or E⊥ ∆S, i.e., component of E along the
unit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.
The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in
principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we
have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the
flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux φ through a
surface S is
φ ~ Σ E.∆S
The approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to
be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact
only when you take the limit ∆S → 0 and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written
as an integral.
An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and –q,
separated by a distance 2a. The line connecting the two charges defines
a direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to
be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is
called the centre of the dipole.
The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not
mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and
–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when
added, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than
the separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields
due to q and –q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole
therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r 2 (the dependence
on r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are
borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:
The electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space
can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.
The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on
the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole,
i.e., on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre. The
electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric
fields E–q due to the charge –q and E+q due to the charge q, by the
parallelogram law of vectors.
Let the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of
the charge q, as shown in Fig. 1.20(a). Then
E −q = −

add up. The total electric field is opposite to p̂ . We have
E = – (E +q + E –q ) cosθ p̂
=− At large distances (r >> a), this reduces to
From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large
distances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product
qa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment
vector p of an electric dipole is defined by
p = q × 2a p̂
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation
from –q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances
takes simple forms:
At a point on the dipole axis
E=− E= At a point on the equatorial plane
E=− and Fields
Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls off not as 1/r 2 but as1/r 3. Further, the magnitude and the direction
of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p.
We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q × 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a
point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any r.
In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges*
lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and
CH4 are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment
when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of
have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric
field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H2O,
is an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting
properties and important applications in the presence or absence of
electric field.
Example 1.10 Two charges ±10 µC are placed 5.0 mm apart.
Determine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole
shown in Fig. 1.21(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line
passing through O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in

The resultant electric field at P due to the two charges at A and B is

In this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can
expect to get approximately the same result as above by directly using
the formula for electric field at a far-away point on the axis of a dipole.
For a dipole consisting of charges ± q, 2a distance apart, the electric
field at a distance r from the centre on the axis of the dipole has a
magnitude
E = where p = 2a q is the magnitude of the dipole moment.
The direction of electric field on the dipole axis is always along the
direction of the dipole moment vector (i.e., from –q to q). Here,

Therefore,

The direction of electric field in this case is opposite to the direction
of the dipole moment vector. Again, the result agrees with that obtained
before.
IN A EXAMPLE 1.10
UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD
Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform
external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.22. (By permanent dipole, we
mean that p exists irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)
There is a force qE on q and a force –qE on –q. The net force on
the dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are
separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque
on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is
independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of FIGURE 1.22 Dipole in a
uniform electric field.
each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular
distance between the two antiparallel forces).
Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinθ
= 2 q a E sinθ
Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.
The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinθ and its direction
is normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,
τ =p×E
This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field
E. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.
What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,
the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there
will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The
general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler
situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In
either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force
on the dipole if E is not uniform.
when p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the
direction of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,
the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing
field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p
with respect to E.
This brings us to a common observation in frictional
electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of
paper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through
friction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains
the attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding
FIGURE 1.23 Electric force on a
dipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b) E
antiparallel to p.
discussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces
a net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field
due to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a
dipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen
that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!
We have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges
q1, q2, ..., qn . One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the
mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For
many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete
charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For
example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify
the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged
constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element ∆S (Fig. 1.24)
on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic
scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and
specify the charge ∆Q on that element. We then define a surface charge
density σ at the area element by
∆Q ∆S We can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at
a continuous function σ, called the surface charge density. The surface
charge density σ so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the
discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. σ represents
macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out
average of the microscopic charge density over an area element ∆S which,
as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The
units for σ are C/m2.
Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume
charge distribution. The linear charge density λ of a wire is defined by
σ= FIGURE 1.24

∆Q ∆l where ∆l is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,
however, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents,
and ∆Q is the charge contained in that line element. The units for λ are
C/m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density)
is defined in a similar manner:
λ = ∆Q ∆V where ∆Q is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume
element ∆V that includes a large number of microscopic charged
constituents. The units for ρ are C/m3.
The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we
adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to
ρ= * At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are
discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.
and Fields
the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We
regard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular
constitution.
The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in
much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose
a continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density ρ. Choose
any convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the
charge distribution be r. The charge density ρ may vary from point to
point, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small
volume elements of size ∆V. The charge in a volume element ∆V is ρ∆V.
Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)
with position vector R (Fig. 1.24). Electric field due to the charge ρ∆V is
given by Coulomb’s law:
ρ ∆V rˆ' r' 2 where r′ is the distance between the charge element and P, and r̂ ′ is a
unit vector in the direction from the charge element to P. By the
superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge
distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different
volume elements:
∆E = ρ ∆V rˆ' all r' 2 Note that ρ, r′, rˆ ′ all can vary from point to point. In a strict
mathematical method, we should let ∆V→0 and the sum then becomes
an integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,
using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can
be determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part
discrete and part continuous.
E≅ As a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the
total flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q
at its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in
The flux through an area element ∆S is
rˆ i ∆S
where we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single
charge q. The unit vector r̂ is along the radius vector from the centre to
the area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is
along the radius vector at that point, the area element ∆S and r̂ have
the same direction. Therefore,
∆φ = E i ∆ S =
∆φ = FIGURE 1.25 Flux

The total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux
through all the different area elements:
φ= Σ all ∆S

distance r from the charge,
FIGURE 1.26 Calculation of the

Now S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4πr 2. Thus,
φ= × 4 πr 2 =
ε0 Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of
electrostatics called Gauss’s law.
We state Gauss’s law without proof:
Electric flux through a closed surface S
= q/ε0
q = total charge enclosed by S.
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is
zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in
the simple situation of Fig. 1.26.
Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed
cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total
flux φ through the surface is φ = φ1 + φ2 + φ3, where φ1 and φ2 represent
the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the
cylinder and φ3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the
closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is
perpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, φ3 = 0. Further, the outward
Therefore,
φ1 = –E S1, φ2 = +E S2
S1 = S2 = S
where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,
as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric
flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge
contained in the closed surface is zero.
The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in
general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let
us note some important points regarding this law:

apply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface
pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due
to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of

any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a

OF GAUSS’S LAW
The electric field due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above,
given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the
summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried
out to give electric field at every point in
space. For some symmetric charge
configurations, however, it is possible to
obtain the electric field in a simple way using
the Gauss’s law. This is best understood by
some examples.
long straight uniformly
charged wire
Consider an infinitely long thin straight wire
with uniform linear charge density λ. The wire
is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we
take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it
around the wire. The points P, P′, P′′ so
obtained are completely equivalent with
respect to the charged wire. This implies that
the electric field must have the same magnitude
at these points. The direction of electric field at
every point must be radial (outward if λ > 0,
inward if λ < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.29.
Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2
of the wire, as shown. The electric fields
produced by the two elements of the pair when
summed give a resultant electric field which
is radial (the components normal to the radial
vector cancel). This is true for any such pair
and hence the total field at any point P is
radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,
electric field does not depend on the position
of P along the length of the wire. In short, the
electric field is everywhere radial in the plane
cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude
depends only on the radial distance r.
To calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical
Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.29(b).
Since the field is everywhere radial, flux
through the two ends of the cylindrical
Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical
part of the surface, E is normal to the surface
at every point, and its magnitude is constant,
since it depends only on r. The surface area
of the curved part is 2πrl, where l is the length
of the cylinder.

E= where n̂ is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing
through the point. E is directed outward if λ is positive and inward if λ is
Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit
vector, i.e., as A = A â , the scalar A is an algebraic number. It can be
vector â if A > 0 and opposite to â if A < 0. When we want to restrict to
Thus, A ≥ 0 .
Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface (λl )
was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire
wire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.
Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved
part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is
approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long
wire, where the end effects may be ignored.
Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet
the electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction
at every point must be parallel to the x-direction.
We can take the Gaussian surface to be a
rectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area
A, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As
seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will
contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel
to the other faces and they, therefore, do not
contribute to the total flux.
The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in –x
direction while the unit vector normal to surface 2
is in the +x direction. Therefore, flux E.∆S through
both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore

E is directed away from the plate if σ is positive and toward the plate
if σ is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has
brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.
For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the
middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.
Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of
radius R (Fig. 1.31). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The
field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial
distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,
along the radius vector).

mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point
of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude
E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and
∆S at every point are parallel and the flux through each
element is E ∆S. Summing over all ∆S, the flux through the
Gaussian surface is E × 4 π r 2. The charge enclosed is
σ × 4 π R 2. By Gauss’s law
E × 4 π r2 =
Or, E =

The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if
q < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge
q placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due
to a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is
concentrated at its centre.
shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.
The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is
E × 4 π r 2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no
charge. Gauss’s law then gives
E × 4 π r2 = 0
i.e., E = 0
that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s
law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of
this result confirms the 1/r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.
Example 1.13 An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
r from the nucleus?
FIGURE 1.32
Solution The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius R must be –Z e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative charge density ρ, since we must have
ρ = 0 – Ze
EXAMPLE 1.13
or ρ = −
To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r
from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a
spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,
φ = E (r ) × 4 π r 2
where E (r ) is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because

and Fields
the field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the
same direction as the normal to the surface there, and has the same
magnitude at all points on the surface.
The charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear
charge and the negative charge within the sphere of radius r,
i.e., q = Z e +
Substituting for the charge density ρ obtained earlier, we have
q = Ze−Ze

spherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s
law, E (r ) × 4 π r 2 = 0 or E (r ) = 0; r > R
At r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.
ON SYMMETRY OPERATIONS
In Physics, we often encounter systems with various symmetries. Consideration of these
symmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward
calculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge
density σ) along the y-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the
y-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x-axis through any angle. As the system
is unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular,
in this example, the electric field E must be unchanged.
Translation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same
at a point (0, y1, 0) as at (0, y2, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis
shows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z1) and (0, 0, z2) must be the same. By
using rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be
perpendicular to the y-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.
Try to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric
field is a constant, independent of the x-coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude
of the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all
points in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of
the sheet.
Compare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation
using Coulomb’s law.
SUMMARY
Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,
molecules and bulk matter.
From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that
there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel
and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod
rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is
then negative.
Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators
do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes
both positive and negative ions are mobile.
Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity
and conservation.
Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body
is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,
q = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges
+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large
Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system
is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)
of all individual charges in the system.
Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an
isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when
bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge
from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.
Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point
charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance r 21 separating them.
Mathematically,
F21 = force on q2 due to q1 =
k (q1q2 )
rˆ21 r21 where r̂21 is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =
is the constant of proportionality.
In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of
the constant ε0 is
ε0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2
The approximate value of k is
k = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2
The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton
and an electron is

Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the
forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not
affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For
an assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is

two charges stated earlier.
force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by
the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has
a magnitude |q|/4πε0r 2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,
and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field
also satisfies superposition principle.
at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that
point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength
of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions
of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is
weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly
spaced parallel straight lines.

For an area element of a closed surface, n̂ is taken to be the direction
of outward normal, by convention.

through the point.

the radius of the shell. q is the total charge of the shell: q = 4πR2σ.
The electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is
concentrated at the centre. The same result is true for a solid sphere
of uniform volume charge density. The field is zero at all points inside
the shell.

POINTS TO PONDER
You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are
compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You
will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the
strong force which holds them together. The range of distance where
this force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14 m. This is precisely
the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on
top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum
mechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature.
law. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while
Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing
possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite
being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive
force in nature.
choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI
units, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic
effect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined
by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is
approximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.
mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of
magnetic forces (forces on current–carrying wires) which are generally
much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit
of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for
electric effects.

Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.
A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an
inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector

interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.

charge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other
charges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces

the configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r 2, typical of field
due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of
this fact.
