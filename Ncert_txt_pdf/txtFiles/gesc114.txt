ou might have tried the game
‘How steady is your hand?’
suggested in Chapter 12 of
Class VI. If not, you may try it out now.
Paheli and Boojho had also set up the
game by connecting an electric circuit
as suggested in Class VI. They had lots
of fun trying it out with their families
and friends. They enjoyed it so much
that they decided to suggest it to a
cousin of theirs who stayed in a
different town. So, Paheli made a neat
drawing showing how the various
electric components were to be
connected (Fig.14.1).

Can you draw this circuit
conveniently? It made Boojho wonder if
there was an easier way to represent
these electric components.

14.1 SYMBOLS OF ELECTRIC
COMPONENTS
Some common electric components can
be represented by symbols. In Table 14.1,
some electric components and their
symbols are shown. You may come
across different symbols for these
components in different books. However,
in this book, we shall be using the
symbols shown here.
Look at the symbols carefully. In the
symbol for the electric cell, notice that
there is a longer line and a shorter but
thicker parallel line. Do you recall that
an electric cell has a positive terminal
and a negative terminal? In the symbol
of the electric cell, the longer line
represents the positive terminal and the
thicker, shorter line represents the
negative terminal.
For a switch the ‘ON’ position and
the ‘OFF’ position are represented by the
symbols as shown. The wires used to
connect the various components in a
circuit are represented by lines.
In Table 14.1, a battery and its
symbol are also shown. Do you know
what a battery is? Look at the symbol of
a battery. Can you make out what a
battery could be? For some of the
activities we may need more than one
cell. So, we connect two or more cells
together as shown in Fig.14.2. Notice

Many devices such as torches,
transistors, toys, TV remote controls, use
batteries. However, in some of these
devices the electric cells are not always
placed one after the other as shown in
Fig. 14.2. Sometimes the cells are placed
side by side. Then how are the terminals
of the cells connected? Look carefully
inside the battery compartment of any
device. There is usually a thick wire or
a metal strip connecting the positive
terminal of one cell to the negative
terminal of the next cell (Fig.14.3). In
order to help you to place the cells
correctly in the battery compartment,
‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols are usually printed
there.
How can we connect the cells to
prepare batteries for our activities? You
may make a cell holder, as shown in
Fig.14.4, using a wooden block, two iron
strips and rubber bands. It is necessary

more cells is called a battery.

Connect a piece of wire each to the two
metal clips on the cell holder as shown
in Fig.14.5. Your battery is ready for
use.
The symbol used for representing a
battery is shown in Table.14.1.
Let us now draw a circuit diagram of
an electric circuit using symbols shown
in Table 14.1.

Paheli and Boojho wonder whether
the batteries used in tractors, trucks
and inverters are also made from cells.
Then why is it called a battery? Can
you help them to find the answer to
this question?

Make the electric circuit shown in
Fig. 14.7. You used a similar circuit in
Class VI to make an electric bulb glow.
Do you remember that the bulb glows
only when the switch is in the ‘ON’
position? The bulb glows as soon as
the switch is moved to the ‘ON’
position.
Copy this electric circuit in your
notebook. Make also a circuit diagram
of this circuit using symbols for the
various electric components.
Is your diagram similar to the one
shown in Fig. 14.8?
It is much easier to draw a circuit
diagram using symbols. Therefore, we
generally represent an electric circuit by
its circuit diagram.
Fig. 14.9 shows another circuit
diagram. Is it identical to the circuit
diagram shown in Fig.14.8? In which
way is it different?
Would the bulb glow in this electric
circuit? Recall that the bulb glows only
when the switch is in the ‘ON’ position
and the electric circuit is closed.

Notice that the key or switch can

Never touch a lighted electric bulb
connected to the mains. It may be very
hot and your hand may get burnt
badly. Do not experiment with the
electric supply from the mains or a
generator or an inverter. You may get
an electric shock, which may be
dangerous. Use only electric cells for
all the activities suggested here.
If the filament of the bulb is broken,
would the circuit be complete? Would
the bulb still glow?
You might have noticed that a

Activity 14.2
Take an electric cell, a bulb, a switch
and connecting wires. Make an electric
circuit as shown in Fig.14.9. This
activity has to be done using only one
cell. Keep the switch in the ‘OFF’

position. Does the bulb glow? Touch
the bulb. Now move the electric switch
to the ‘ON’ position and let the bulb glow
for a minute or so. Again touch the bulb.
Do you feel any difference? After moving
the switch back to the ‘OFF’ position,
touch the bulb again.

The wire gets hot when an electric
current passes through it. This is the
heating effect of the electric current.
Can you think of any electric appliance
where the heating effect of the electric
current is used? Make a list of such
appliances.

Activity 14.3
Make a circuit as shown in Fig.14.10.
Take about 10 cm long piece of nichrome
wire and tie it between the nails. (You

repair shop or you can use a piece of
discarded coil of an electric heater.)

element. You may have noticed that
when these appliances are switched on
Boojho could not see element in an
electric iron. Paheli told him that
electrical appliances, such as
immersion heaters, hotplates, irons,
geysers, electric kettles, hair dryers,
have elements inside them. Have you
ever seen the element in any
appliance?

after connecting to the electric supply,
their elements become red hot and give
out heat.
The amount of heat produced in a
wire depends on its material, length
and thickness. Thus, for different

requirements, the wires of different
materials and different lengths and
thicknesses are used.
The wires used for making electric
circuits do not normally become hot. On
the other hand, the elements of some
electric appliances become so hot that
they are easily visible. The filament of
an electric bulb gets heated to such a
high temperature that it starts glowing.
If a large current passes through a
wire, the wire may become so hot that it
may even melt and break. But is it
possible for a wire to melt and break?
Let us check it out.

Activity 14.4
Make the circuit we used for Activity 14.3
again. However, replace the cell with a
battery of four cells. Also, in place of

An electric bulb is used for light but it also gives heat. This is not desirable. This
results in the wastage of electricity. This wastage can be reduced by using
fluorescent tube lights in place of the bulbs. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
also reduce wastage and can be fixed in the ordinary bulb holders.

Fig. 14.13 Tube lights and CFLs

However, before buying bulbs or tubes, or CFLs, look for the ISI mark of the
Bureau of Indian Standards. In fact, before buying any electrical appliance,
look for this mark. The ISI mark ensures that the appliance is safe and wastage
of energy is minimum.

the nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of
steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens. Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.14.14). In all
buildings fuses are inserted in all
electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
may become overheated and may cause
fire. If a proper fuse is there in the circuit,
it will blow off and break the circuit. A
fuse is thus a safety device which
prevents damages to electrical circuits
and possible fires.
166

Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes. Fig. 14.14 shows
fuses used in our houses. Fuses
shown in Fig. 14.15 are generally used
in electrical appliances.
CAUTION
Never try to investigate an electric fuse
connected to mains circuit on your
own. You may, however, visit an
electric repair shop and compare the
burnt out fuses with the new ones.
One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
off due to wear and tear. This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket. This may cause overload in
the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.
We observed the heating effect of the
electric current and learnt how we use
it to our advantage. Does the electric
current have other effects also?
SCIENCE

These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit
exceeds the safe limit. You
turn them on and the
circuit is once again
complete. Look for ISI
mark on MCBs also.

circuit breaker (MCB)

CAUTION
Always, use proper fuses which have
been specified for particular
applications, carrying ISI mark. Never
use just any wire or strip of metal in
place of a fuse.

14.3 MAGNETIC EFFECT OF
ELECTRIC CURRENT
Activity 14.5
Take the cardboard tray from inside a
discarded matchbox. Wrap an electric
wire a few times around the cardboard
tray. Place a small compass needle
inside it. Now connect the free ends of
this wire to an electric cell through a
switch as shown in Fig.14.17.
Note the direction in which the
compass needle is pointing. Bring a bar
magnet near the compass needle.
Observe what happens. Now, while
watching the compass needle carefully,
move the switch to the ‘ON’ position.
ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS

Fig. 14.17 Effect of current on a
compass needle

What do you observe? Does the compass
needle deflect? Move the switch back to
the ‘OFF’ position. Does the compass
needle come back to its initial position?
Repeat the experiment a few times.
What does this experiment indicate?
We know that the needle of a compass
is a tiny magnet, which points in
north-south direction. When we bring
a magnet close to it, the needle gets
deflected. We have also seen that

(A.D. 1777-1851)
167

compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 14.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising? Let us try it out.

14.4 ELECTROMAGNET
Activity 14.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6–10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire

Remember not to switch on the
current for more than a few seconds
at a time. The electromagnet weakens

to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig 14.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 13
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
the eye. Many toys also have
electromagnets inside them.

14.5 ELECTRIC BELL

We are quite familiar with an electric bell.
It has an electromagnet in it. Let us see
how it works.
Fig. 14.20 shows the circuit of an
electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire
wound on an iron piece. The coil acts
SCIENCE

as an electromagnet. An iron strip with
a hammer at one end is kept close to
the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,

Fig. 14. 20 Circuit of an electric bell

pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again. This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed. This is how
the bell rings.
